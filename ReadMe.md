# 2.3 Do Now

Let's try and write some code! Follow the directions below:

1. Go to line 13. Try and change the **black** text to say your name instead of "Hello Coder!". DO NOT change the green text!

2. Now go to line 14. Change the **black** text to be the city you live in. DO NOT change the green text!

3. Finally, go to line 15. Change the **black** text to be the school you go to. DO NOT change the green text!

**Optional: Finish early and want a challenge?** Try to make another line in the white box which says your favorite type of music. *Hint*: Use lines 9 and 10 as a guide!
